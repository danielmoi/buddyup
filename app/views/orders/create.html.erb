<h2>Thanks, you have pledged <strong>$<%= sprintf("%.2f", @amount / 100.0) %></strong>!</h2>

<p>Congratulations, you are on your way to achieving your goal.</p>
<p>Why not set up some targets to start you on your journey?</p>

<div class="btn-container">
  <%= link_to 'Set a Target', goal_path(@goal), :class => 'btn' %>
</div>
<p>Start by doing what's necessary; then do what's possible; and suddenly you are doing the
impossible</p>
