# BuddyUP

BuddyUP is a motivational app to support people achieving goals.
Did you know that you're more likely to achieve your goals with the support and encouragement of a buddy? Here at BuddyUP we want everyone to succeed in all their endeavours, so we created a global support network for all!

Sign up and browse the available goals or set up your own goal. Find a new friend to BuddyUp with and achieve your goals together.

Pledge a minimum of $50 and once your goals are achieved both of your pledges will be donated to the Charity of the Month. What do you want to succeed at today? Jump in and BuddyUp!
